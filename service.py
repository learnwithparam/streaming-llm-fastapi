What is Prompt Engineering?
- The art of writing instructions that guide AI to produce desired output
- Good prompts are: clear, specific, and structured
- This is where you teach the AI what you want

Key Prompt Engineering Techniques Used Here:
1. Role-Setting: Tell the AI who it is ("bedtime storyteller")
2. Context: Provide user inputs (character name, age, theme)
3. Instructions: Specify format, length, style
4. Constraints: Set boundaries (age-appropriate, specific word count)

💡 Try This: Modify this prompt and see how the story quality changes!

Requirements:
1. Start with an engaging title
2. Write in clear paragraphs with natural breaks
3. Make it age-appropriate for a {request.character_age}-year-old
4. End with a gentle moral lesson about kindness, bravery, or friendship
5. Keep the tone warm, comforting, and suitable for bedtime

What is Streaming?
- Instead of waiting for the entire story, send it piece by piece
- Creates a "typing" effect like ChatGPT
- Feels faster and more interactive to users

How Streaming Works:
1. AI generates text in small chunks (tokens)
2. Each chunk is sent immediately to the frontend
3. Frontend displays chunks as they arrive
4. User sees story appear in real-time

Technical Details:
- Uses async generators (async functions with 'yield')
- Formats as Server-Sent Events (SSE) with "data: {json}\n\n"
- Keeps connection alive until story is complete
