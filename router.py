What is an API Endpoint?
- A URL that clients can call to access functionality
- Each endpoint does one specific thing
- Uses HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.) to indicate the action

Endpoint Design Principles:
1. Clear naming (/stream, /themes, /health)
2. Single responsibility (each endpoint does one thing)
3. Proper HTTP methods (POST for creating, GET for reading)
4. Meaningful responses (status codes, clear data)

Understanding the Code Flow:
POST /bedtime-story/stream
  → Validates request (automatic via Pydantic)
  → Calls generate_story_stream()
  → Returns StreamingResponse that sends data in real-time
  → Frontend receives chunks and displays them

    Main endpoint: Generates and streams a bedtime story

    1. Receives story parameters (character name, age, theme, length)
    2. Validates the data automatically (via Pydantic model)
    3. Streams the generated story in real-time
    4. Returns a StreamingResponse for Server-Sent Events
    
    Frontend Usage:
    The frontend connects to this endpoint and listens for events:
    - First event: {"status": "connected", "message": "..."}
    - Following events: {"content": "Once upon a time..."}
    - Final event: {"done": true, "status": "completed"}
